- 👋 Hi, I’m @hlembeck
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, algorithms, and algebra.
- 🌱 I’m recently studied C, networking, NodeJS, and ReactJS. Now, I'm learning 3D rendering with DirectX 12, a topic that I've been interested in for quite some time. Currently, I'm writing a program to simulate celestial mechanics, that allows the player to zoom in and out of celestial bodies to extreme degrees.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can!
- 📫 How to reach me: 
  Email: hele2087@colorado.edu
